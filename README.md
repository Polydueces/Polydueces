- 👋 Hi, WELCOME TO THE FIRST GALACTIC BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM
Join us in the first interactive massive space NFT.
Polydueces combines all aspects of blockchain and NFTs.
Our first solar system is composed of 18 planets and 34 moons 5 asteroids 2 comets and 1 worm hole. Each one of the planets are numbered and the rarity is based on the number of cards.  You can be part of the first solar system by  purchasing collectable cards OR getting bounties/rewards by creating content. Each planet and moon is completely unique and rare!

Each purchase is backed by an XLM contract that ties your card/land/resource with a (NFT) contract using the Stellar Blockchain. Polydueces has its own in galaxy currency that the community will use to collect and unlock exciting items in the universe!

- 👀 I’m interested in developing NFT value through content and other exciting new features. Most NFT's have ZERO vaule aside from the face vaule. At Polydueces we are changing that. We believe in community involvment and ORGANIC growth. The entire universe is transparent and open.
